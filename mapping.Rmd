# Mapping in R with `sf` {#sf}

There are a variety of spatial mapping/plotting packages in R. Currently, there are two main approaches to read/create spatial data in R. The `rgdal` package, and the `sf` package. We're going to use the `sf` approach because it's simpler and typically faster to work with, and spatial objects are simply `data.frames`, which makes it much easier to manipulate data.

## Install/Load packages

Next we need to install our packages (if you haven't already). If you have already done this step, great, take a minute to look at the [`sf` webpage](http://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) and the various vignettes that are available (see __*Articles*__ tab).

```{r installsf, echo=T, eval=F}

# install packages if you haven't already
install.packages(c("sf","mapview", "tmap","USAboundaries","viridis"))

# load packages or "libraries"
library(tidyverse) # wrangling/plotting tools
library(viridis) # nice color palette
library(sf) # newer "simple features" spatial package
library(mapview) # interactive web mapping
library(tmap) # static mapping
library(USAboundaries) # data for USA boundaries

```

```{r load libs, echo=F, warning=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(tidyverse); # reading/writing files
  library(viridis); # nice color palette
  library(sf); # newer "simple features" spatial package
  library(mapview); # interactive web map
  library(tmap);
  library(USAboundaries)
  }) 

```

## Read in Data

First we need to read in some data. We'll be using the same data from earlier in the lessons...see the Github repository](https://github.com/SCCWRP/CABW2018_R_training/tree/master/data). Let's use the `read_csv` function from the `tidyverse (readr)` package to read in our `.csv`'s. 

```{r getData, eval=T, echo=T}

# if reading locally:
# ascidat <- read_csv("data/ascidat.csv")
# cscidat <- read_csv("data/cscidat.csv")
# latlons <- read_csv("data/latlon.csv")

# if reading from web:
ascidat <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCCWRP/CABW2018_R_training/master/data/ascidat.csv")

cscidat <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCCWRP/CABW2018_R_training/master/data/cscidat.csv")

# read in latitude/longitude data for sites:
latlons <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCCWRP/CABW2018_R_training/master/data/latlon.csv")

```

Let's take a look at our dataset, and in particular, let's look at the coordinates we'll be using to make our data "spatial". The `latlons` dataset just has three columns. How many rows?

If we look at a summary of the latitude and longitude, what do we notice? Why might it be important to look at the latitude and longitude data[^1] before plotting?

```{r summLats}

glimpse(latlons)
summary(latlons)

```

[^1]: For data from the North American continent, keep an eye on your lat/long coordinates, especially **longitude**. It should be `negative`. A common snafu that can occur is a few values (or all) from the longitude column may remain positive, which means the data typically plots somewhere in the Indian Ocean. Make sure all your longitudes are negative (if in the US and using lat/longs).

### Fix the Spatial Data

In case there is something amiss, such as values that aren't negative, a quick fix is to run the following code to make sure all longitude values are negative.

```{r Fixlatlong, echo=F, eval=F}

latlons$New_Long <- abs(latlons$New_Long) * -1 # make all values negative

```

### Make Data Spatial & Plot

Once we are sure our data are ok and things have been vetted, let's make the data spatial and create a few quick test plots. To make the data spatial using `sf`, we need to know two important pieces...

 - Which columns are the spatial coordinates in (either name or number)?
 - What projection or CRS do we want to use?

```{r makespatial}

# set projections
# utms <- CRS("+init=epsg:32610") ## more detailed def using the EPSG code
# lats84<-CRS("+init=epsg:4326") # set the default for lat/longs
# lats84

# make data sf object: 
df_sf <- st_as_sf(latlons,
                  # coords = c("Lon", "Lat"), # can use numbers here too
                  coords = c(3, 2), # can use numbers here too
                  remove = F, # don't remove these lat/lon cols from df
                  crs = 4326) # add projection (this is WGS84)

```

### Plotting with `sf` Data

Now we can make a few quick plots to see how our data looks. The simplest option is to use the `plot` function. However, if we try to plot by running: 

 - `plot(df_sf)`
 
 We see something like this:
 
 ![](images/plot_df_sf.png)

Baseplotting functions work with `sf`, but be aware, using `plot` will default to plotting a facet or map for every column of data in your dataframe. Avoid that by specifying `st_coordinates()` or `$geometry` to ensure only one iteration gets plotted.

```{r single_sf1}
# single layer
plot(df_sf$geometry)

# add some flair
plot(df_sf$geometry, col = "orange")
```


```{r single_sf2, eval=F, echo=T}

# this is better
plot(st_coordinates(df_sf), pch=16, col=adjustcolor("maroon", alpha=0.7), cex=1.5)
graphics::title("A Map")

```

## Plotting Interactive Maps

One of the nicest/coolest packages you'll find for mapping, is the `mapview` package. As long as data are in an `sf` format, you can quickly make some very nice and interactive maps of your data/sites.

```{r quick_mapview, echo=T, eval=T}

# check data is in sf format?
class(df_sf)
# should say: "sf"         "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"

# make a map
mapview::mapview(df_sf)

```

## Get some Boundary Data for State and County

Now we have our data, let's use some boundaries to crop/buffer and manipulate around the data. While there are loads of options available, I'll show two. A package called `USAboundaries`, which allows us to quickly download county or state outlines, in `sf` formats. Very handy for making some quick professional maps.

```{r getCA, echo=T, eval=T}

# library(USAboundaries)

# Pick a State
state_names <- c("california") # notice we can add more states to this list if we want

# Download STATE data and add projection
CA<-us_states(resolution = "high", states = state_names) %>% # what does resolution do?
  st_transform(crs = 4269) # defaults to 4326

st_crs(CA) # double check the CRS

# make a quick plot!
plot(CA$geometry)

# add data from above? use "add=TRUE"
plot(df_sf$geometry, col="blue", add=TRUE)


```

### Quick Challenge:

## Plotting with `ggplot` and `ggmap`

Alternatively, we can use `ggplot2` instead. This is where `sf` objects are really nice. They fit well within the ggplot framework because they are simply dataframes with a spatial list-column. You can plot XY data as a regular layer, or you can use the `geom_sf` function. 

The only caveat here is we currently (as of `r Sys.Date()`) need the most recent version of `ggplot2`: `r packageVersion("ggplot2")` (use `packageVersion("ggplot2)` to check). If you don't have this, you can try installing the development version from github:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")

```

Once we have the dev version of `ggplot2`, we can make a fancier plot.

```{r mapXY_sf2, eval=F, echo=T}
# fancier ggplot w google background plot:
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap) # need this package
location=c(-119.7,38.7) # set the center of the map

# set the background map up
map1 <- get_map(location=location, crop = F,
             color="bw",
             maptype="satellite",
             source="google",
             zoom=8)

sitemap <- ggmap(map1) # start a ggmap... like calling ggplot()

# and let's make our nicemap
nicemap<-
  sitemap + 
  geom_point(data=df_locs_sf, aes(x=Lon, y=Lat, fill=Temp_F), pch=21, alpha=0.7, size=4)+
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "A")+
  labs(x="Longitude (WGS84)", y="Latitude",
       title="Hot Springs in California") + 
  theme_bw(base_family = "Roboto Condensed") # change this to sans if it doesn't plot
nicemap

# To save plot
# ggsave(filename = "./figs/site_map_ggplot.png", width = 8, height = 6, units = "in", dpi = 300)
