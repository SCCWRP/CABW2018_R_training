# CABW 2018 R training

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language for statistical computing as well as a general purpose programming language. Increasingly, it has become one of the primary languages used in data science and for data analysis across many of the natural sciences. This workshop will provide attendees with the foundations for continued learning of R and for analysis of a range of data types. 

## Course objectives

By the end of this course you should be able to or have the resources to find out how to:

* Use R to import and organize bioassessment data 

* Create plots using R packages to explore data trends

* Create maps in R to explore spatial patterns and generate reports

## Agenda

* __1 - 2pm__: Using R with bioassessment data: what, why, and how

* __2 - 3pm__: Wrangling and plotting bioassessment data for exploratory analysis

* __3 - 4pm__: Mapping bioassessment data for reporting
